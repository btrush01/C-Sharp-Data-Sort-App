# C-Sharp-Data-Sort-App

This simple data sorting program takes data from a specific .csv file, "games.csv", sorts by a selected parameter, and writes the result to a specific .csv file, "reorder.csv". To run the program, simply compile the code found in "Program.cs", and run the "ChessApp.exe" executable generated in the bin\debug directory. Follow the direcions of the simple menu that appears, and you should find the reordered data written in "reorder.csv".
